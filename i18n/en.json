        "STORY": "As consultants, we have helped many customers further in the digitization of purchase invoices, but after 10 years of customized services to automate temporary staffing, we were fed up with it. We noticed that every success at the hirer led to an extra cost item at the broadcaster. More and more often we asked ourselves the question: 'why should we keep busy with the same sub-optimization every time?' The conviction grew that it had to be better. It was a major puzzle, connecting 'thinking in purchase orders' as recipients do with 'thinking in collective labor agreements' to the nature of employment agencies, but it has succeeded. We have managed to integrate system integration in the flexible labor market into a complete model of unburdening. FlexForceMonkey is live and brings success for both users and lenders."
