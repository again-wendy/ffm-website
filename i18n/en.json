We send the personal data of the flexworker to your system in such a way that an order can be made immediately and that time can be registered on this order, including all collective labor agreement complexities. Of course we expect a message back with written hours, so that we can check the invoice of the supplier before we send it."

        "OPTION_2": "When you are a size smaller as a temporary employment agency, or that it is about supporting a customer that you do not do so much business with, you can also opt for manual work with our portal. Then you prevent the one-time implementation of digital integration with our platform. The process is no different, only an intermediary of your company then manually keeps the data on our platform and we still ensure that this is correctly included in the process of your customer."
